# Presentations

Your group will do a presentation on a paper or system for the class. Each group will present once. Presentations should last 15-20 minutes. Each student in the group must present for an equal amount of time. You may present in whatever manner you feel works best for your topic (slides, whiteboard talk, demo, etc.)

## Paper presentations
Presentations on research papers should address the following questions:
- What is the central problem tackled by the paper? 
- What is the chief contribution of the paper?
- How does this paper relate to systems, techniques, and/or papers we have seen in class?
- What experiments did the authors do to validate their ideas? 
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper? Doe the central idea make sense? Did the authors do a good job evaluating their idea?
- What are the limitations of the paper's approach?

## System presentations
Presentations on systems (e.g. QEMU, Kubernetes) should include the following content:
- What problem does the system solve? In what contexts is this system used?
- What is the historical context of the system? What systems preceded (and/or succeeded it)? 
- What virtualization technologies and approaches that we have discussed in class does the system use? 
- What are the major limitations/criticisms of the system? 
- A demo of the system.

# Grading

This presentation is worth 20% of your grade. You should read your paper or research your system in depth, along with skimming related work for context. The goal of the presentation should be to present the key contributions, ideas, strengths, and weaknesses of your paper or system in an accessible way.

There are 40 points total to earn on this assignment. 25 points come from your summary of the key points of the paper/system and putting it in context with related work. 15 points come from critical analysis and commentary of the paper/system - its strengths, weaknesses, and limitations.
