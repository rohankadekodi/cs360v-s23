# Project 2

For project 2, you will work on an open-source repository related to virtualization. You will select several open issues from the respository and work with maintainers to implement a fix/feature/change for each issue. 

Students learn a lot from this project, but it takes a lot of time to set up. We recommend starting on this project **early** and working on it concurrently with Project 1. Project 1's last due date is about a month before Project 2 is due, and Project 2 cannot be completed in a month. You will need to budget time to communicate with maintainers (who may or may not respond in a timely manner), to understand the components of the large codebases you will be working with, and to implement the changes. 

# Recommended open-source projects

This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to explore other projects!

Search for "help wanted" or "good first issue" tags on these repositories to find issues that developers want help with. You can also politely email developers to ask about appropriate projects; there may be features or bugs that are not listed on Github that they would like help with. Previous students have had success with this approach. Please CC the course staff on initial emails to developers.

# Deadlines

These deadlines are tentative.

TODO: deadlines for submitting issue proposals to course staff, finalizing issues, and submitting report. 

# Grading rubric

30% of your grade comes from Project 2. 

Tentative rubric:
- x points come from submitting your proposed issues to course staff by (TODO: deadline)
- y points come from your final report on the issues, due **April 27, 2023**.
- z (5-10% of grade?) points come from completing the chosen issues or for a detailed explanation of challenges that prevented you from completing the issues. This does not include whether or not your changes are merged. We will not dock points for unforeseen challenges that prevent a group from finishing an issue (e.g., technical limitations that arose late in the project, a higher level of complexity than initially predicted, etc.) but we do expect an in-depth explanation of why an issue could not be finished by the due date.  

If you get any issue merged into an open-source repository related to virtualization, you will receive extra credit! The issue can be related to Project 2, but it does not have to be. Submit a link to merged pull request the extra credit assignments on Canvas to receive credit.
