# Project 2

For project 2, you will work on an open-source repository related to virtualization. You will select several open issues from the respository and work with maintainers to implement a fix/feature/change for each issue. 

Students learn a lot from this project, but it takes a lot of time to set up. We recommend starting on this project **early** and working on it concurrently with Project 1. Project 1's last due date is about a month before Project 2 is due, and Project 2 cannot be completed in a month. You will need to budget time to communicate with maintainers (who may or may not respond in a timely manner), to understand the components of the large codebases you will be working with, and to implement the changes. 

You will complete Project 2 in a group of 2-4 students. Please sign up for an existing Project 2 group on the "People" tab on Canvas. Your Project 2 group does not need to be the same as your Project 1 or Presentation groups.

# Recommended open-source projects

This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to explore other projects!

Search for "help wanted" or "good first issue" tags on these repositories to find issues that developers want help with. You can also politely email developers to ask about appropriate projects; there may be features or bugs that are not listed on Github that they would like help with. Previous students have had success with this approach. Please CC the course staff on initial emails to developers.

# Deadlines

We **strongly** recommend discussing issues with course staff and reaching out to developers much earlier than these deadlines. Maintainers may take a long time to respond and issues may end up being more challenging than initially expected. Course staff must approve all issues. A small part of your grade on Project 2 comes from hitting these deadlines. 

Deadlines TBD
<!-- February 23, 2023: Deadline to propose issues to course staff on Piazza.
March 23, 2023: Deadline to have a confirmed list of issues and responses from developers. Submit the final list of issues and links to Github issues (if possible) on Canvas. -->

# Grading rubric

Course staff will assign each proposed issue a score based on its difficulty. Easy issues are worth 1 point, medium issues are worth 2, and hard issues are worth 3. A group of 2 students must take on a set of issues worth 3 points, a group of 3 students must reach 4 points, and a group of 4 students must reach 5 points. Each group must take at least one medium or hard issue, but otherwise can combine issues in any way they like. For example, a group of 2 could do one easy and one medium issue, or they could do one hard issue. 

30% of your grade comes from Project 2. It is worth 60 total points.
- 5 points for getting issues approved by course staff by the deadline.
- 20 points for completing the proposed issues. You do not have to get your fixes merged into the repository, but you will need to provide your code and describe in your report how you resolved each issue.
- 30 points for your project report. More details on the contents of the report will be added soon.

If you get any issue merged into an open-source repository related to virtualization, you will receive extra credit! The issue can be related to Project 2, but it does not have to be. Submit a link to merged pull request the extra credit assignments on Canvas to receive credit.
